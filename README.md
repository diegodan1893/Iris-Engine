# Iris Engine
Iris Engine is a visual novel engine that will help you tell interactive stories.

Its scripting language, [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), is really easy to learn, so
you will be able to express your ideas even if you don't know anything about
programming. Here is an example of a conversation between two characters:

```lua
-- First, give a name to your characters
h = Character.new("Haru")
s = Character.new("Sakura")

-- And let them speak
h "Hi there!"
s "This is all you need to do to display dialogue on the screen."
h "Easy, right?"
```

Please note that Iris Engine is still in development and some important features
have not been implemented yet. Using it for production is not recommended.
